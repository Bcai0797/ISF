# ISF
The official PyTorch implementation of the paper 'Learning Survival Distribution with Implicit Survival Function' at IJCAI23. ISF is proposed to estimate a continuous survival distribution through Implicit Neural Representation and approximate CDF through Numerical Integration.

# Requirement

- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.12.0
